# PRD — Visual Ingredient Scanner · Flutter Mobile App (Phase 3)

**Status:** Draft for Phase 3 (Flutter app, 15–17 June 2026)
**Owners:** Pol Plana, Emma Nájera, Houda El Fezzak
**Scope:** **Mobile app only.** Port the validated Phase 2 Python pipeline to an on-device
Flutter app, with all CV models **compiled into the app bundle**, the detector and depth
models **selectable at runtime**, an **editable density table**, **persistence**, depth/box
**visualisations**, a **manual distance correction**, and **manual annotation of undetected
food**.

This is the build spec. It assumes the five-stage pipeline, runtime stack, and constraints
already fixed in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). Read that first.

---

## 1. Goal & success criteria

Point a phone at a fridge/counter → tap → on-device detection + metric depth + weight
estimation → one Gemini call → 3 recipes. The user can change which models run, correct
scale, and fix detections — all on-device.

| # | Criterion | Target |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | End-to-end latency, capture → results (Pixel 9 simulator / demo device) | < 10 s |
| G2 | Detection mAP50-95 on food test set (shipped model) | > 40 % |
| G3 | Model / density / setting changes survive an app restart | persisted |
| G4 | Model selection takes effect on next scan | no rebuild |
| G5 | App runs fully offline except the single Gemini recipe call | — |
| G6 | Distance correction & manual boxes recompute weights **without re-running the models** | reuse cached depth map |

---

## 2. Models bundled in the app

Only **ONNX** assets are shipped — both stages run through `flutter_onnxruntime` (ORT 1.22) on device, giving a
single inference code path for detector and depth.

### 2.1 Detector models (YOLO, selectable)
Ship **only** the two correctly-exported NMS-baked ONNX detectors:

| id | File | Source | I/O |
|---|---|---|---|
| `v26m_e30` (default) | `assets/models/epoch30.onnx` | `models/yolo/v26m/v26m_v7/epoch30.onnx` (~78 MB) | in `images[1,3,640,640]` → out `output0[1,300,6]` |
| `v26m_e40` | `assets/models/epoch40.onnx` | `models/yolo/v26m/v26m_v7/epoch40.onnx` (~78 MB) | same as above |

- `output0[1,300,6]` rows are `[x1, y1, x2, y2, score, class_id]` in 640×640 space — **NMS is
  already baked in**. No manual NMS in Dart; just threshold on `score` and rescale boxes to the
  original image.
- ✅ Both `epoch30.onnx` and `epoch40.onnx` exist on disk and share the verified I/O above. All
  other `.pt` / older variants are **excluded**.

### 2.2 Depth models (selectable — the "scale" model)
| id | File | family | size | role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `metric3d` (default) | `assets/models/metric3d-vit-small-fp16.onnx` | `metric3d` | 72 MB | true metric depth |
| `depthanything` | `assets/models/depth_anything_v2_small.onnx` (+`.data`) | `depthanything` | ~96 MB | relative-depth alternative |

`family` selects the preprocessing branch (mirrors [depth.py](../pipeline/depth.py): Metric3D →
canonical 616×1064 + de-canonicalise with focal; Depth Anything → 518×518). On mobile we key off
`family` explicitly instead of sniffing ONNX outputs.

### 2.3 Density data (editable, not a model)
- `assets/data/food_densities.json` — bundled baseline ([data/food_densities.json](../data/food_densities.json)).
- `assets/data/labels.txt` — class list from [data/classes.yaml](../data/classes.yaml) (86 classes),
  in detector output-index order. App asserts length 86 at load.
- User edits to densities are stored as a **persisted override map** merged over the baseline.

### 2.4 Model registry (drives the pickers)
`assets/model_registry.json`:
```json
{
  "detectors": [
    {"id":"v26m_e30","label":"YOLO v26m · epoch30 (default)","asset":"models/epoch30.onnx","inputSize":640,"default":true},
    {"id":"v26m_e40","label":"YOLO v26m · epoch40","asset":"models/epoch40.onnx","inputSize":640}
  ],
  "depth": [
    {"id":"metric3d","label":"Metric3D ViT-S (metric)","asset":"models/metric3d-vit-small-fp16.onnx","family":"metric3d","default":true},
    {"id":"depthanything","label":"Depth Anything V2-S (relative)","asset":"models/depth_anything_v2_small.onnx","family":"depthanything"}
  ]
}
```

---

## 3. Architecture

```
ScanScreen (camera) ──capture──> ScanController  (orchestrates, runs models on an Isolate)
   │                                  │  caches: detections + raw depth map + focal_px
   ├─ DetectorService  ← flutter_onnxruntime  │
   ├─ DepthService     ← flutter_onnxruntime  │
   ├─ DensityService   ← food_densities.json + user overrides
   ├─ WeightService    ← pure Dart (pinhole + shapes)  ◄── re-run cheaply on corrections (G6)
   └─ RecipeService    ← Gemini (single network call after ingredient confirmation)
   │
   ├─ ResultScreen  (confirm ingredients + weights; bbox on by default; optional depth map;
   │                 distance-correction slider; edit items)
   ├─ RecipeScreen  (swipeable recipe cards; save; finish)
   ├─ SavedRecipesScreen  (My recipes history)
   └─ SettingsScreen (detector picker · depth picker · density editor · toggles · API key)

SettingsRepository (shared_preferences + local JSON file) ── persists everything (G3)
```

- All model inference on a background **Isolate** — never block the UI (CLAUDE.md).
- State via `provider` / `ChangeNotifier` (no Riverpod/Bloc).
- **Recompute path (G6):** corrections (distance anchor, manual box, density edit, threshold)
  reuse the **cached depth map + detections** and only re-run `WeightService` — no model
  re-inference.

---

## 4. Functional requirements

### FR1 — Scan & results
Live camera → single capture (EXIF/focal retained) → Isolate runs detector + depth → density
lookup → weights. ResultScreen is the ingredient-confirmation step: it lists weighed items,
shows bounding boxes by default, keeps the depth map off by default, offers scale adjustment,
and then exposes a Get recipes action.

### FR2 — Model selection (Settings)
- **Detector model** radio picker (from registry `detectors`).
- **Depth model** radio picker (from registry `depth`).
- Selection persisted; applied on the **next scan** (G4), no restart.

### FR3 — Density table editor (Settings)
- Searchable list of all 86 classes with current kg/m³ (baseline or override).
- Edit any value; "reset to default" per row and globally.
- Overrides persisted (G3) and merged over the baseline by `DensityService`.
- Editing a value used in the current scan **recomputes** weights live (G6).

### FR4 — Persistence
`SettingsRepository` persists: selected detector id, depth id, confidence threshold, density
overrides, visualisation toggles, and Gemini API key. Restored on launch (G3).

### FR5 — Visualisations
- **Bounding-box overlay**: detected boxes + labels drawn over the captured frame.
- **Depth-map view**: colour-mapped depth (e.g. turbo/viridis) of the cached depth map.
- Bounding boxes are **on by default**. The depth map is **off by default**. Toggle state
  persisted.

### FR6 — Distance correction (manual scale anchor)
- On ResultScreen, the user picks one detected (or manual) object and sets the **real
  camera-to-object distance** with a slider (e.g. 0.1–2.0 m).
- The app computes `scale = user_distance / median_depth_of_that_object`, multiplies the
  **cached depth map** by `scale`, and **recomputes all** real dimensions, volumes and weights
  (G6) — no model re-run. A "reset" restores the model's original depth.
- Purpose: correct Metric3D's known scale ambiguity on featureless close-ups.

### FR7 — Manual annotation of undetected food
- "Add missing item" tool: the user **draws a rectangle** on the captured image and **picks a
  class** from the density list (the food_densities classes).
- The box becomes a synthetic detection (default confidence), runs through depth sampling +
  `WeightService`, and joins the results + recipe input. Editable/removable.

### FR8 — Recipes
`RecipeService` via `google_generative_ai`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`, JSON-validated 3 recipes,
generated only after the user confirms ingredients. RecipeScreen makes one Gemini call for that
ingredient snapshot, displays swipeable cards, lets the user save recipes, and the home screen
exposes saved recipes through My recipes.
**API key is per-user**: entered in Settings and stored in `flutter_secure_storage`
(Keychain/Keystore) — never bundled in the app and never written to the plaintext prefs blob, so
there is no shared secret to extract by reverse-engineering. (No `.env` in the app: a bundled key
is always extractable; the serverless design rules out a backend proxy, so per-user keys are the
secure option.)

---

## 5. One-off prerequisite (before app integration) — ✅ DONE

Both detectors are exported to the NMS-baked ONNX format and I/O-verified
(`images[1,3,640,640]` → `output0[1,300,6]`): `epoch30.onnx` and `epoch40.onnx` (~78 MB each)
under `models/yolo/v26m/v26m_v7/`. Remaining check for S8: confirm both depth ONNX files load
under the mobile ORT build (the Metric3D fp16 graph needs reduced graph optimisation — see
[depth.py](../pipeline/depth.py:38)).

---

## 6. Dart port reference (port faithfully — do not redesign the math)

| Service | Ports from | Must preserve |
|---|---|---|
| `DetectorService` | [detect.py](../pipeline/detect.py) | letterbox to 640; decode `[1,300,6]`; threshold on score (default 0.10); rescale xyxy to original px |
| `DepthService` | [depth.py](../pipeline/depth.py) | **Metric3D recipe exactly:** keep-aspect resize into 616×1064, centre-pad with ImageNet mean (0–255), normalise, run, un-pad, resize back, then `depth_m = raw × (focal_px × resize_scale / 1000)`. Depth Anything: 518×518, ImageNet norm 0–1 |
| `WeightService` | [weight.py](../pipeline/weight.py) | pinhole `real=(bbox_px/focal_px)×depth_m`; depth = **median** of bbox ROI clamped [0.1,10] m; sphere/cylinder/box volume + box ×0.5; `weight_g=vol×density×1000`; sphere/cylinder class sets identical to Python |
| `DensityService` | [density.py](../pipeline/density.py) | baseline JSON + user overrides; unknown class → 800 kg/m³ |
| `RecipeService` | [recipe.py](../pipeline/recipe.py) | `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`; JSON; graceful degradation |

**Focal length (load-bearing — feeds both depth de-canonicalisation and the pinhole model):**
EXIF `FocalLengthIn35mmFilm` (0xA405) → `focal_px=(focal_35mm/36)×image_width_px`; fallback
`focal_px=image_width_px×0.8`. The capture path must retain EXIF or read focal from camera
metadata.

---

## 7. Implementation steps (sequential — implement & commit one after another)

Each step is a single self-contained commit. Do them in order; later steps assume earlier ones.

**S0 — Export `epoch40.onnx`** (§5). ✅ **DONE** — `epoch30.onnx` and `epoch40.onnx` exist and
are I/O-verified.

**S1 — Flutter scaffold.** ✅ **DONE.** Created `mobile/` via
`flutter create --org edu.upc.fib.cv --project-name visual_ingredient_scanner --platforms=android,ios`
(Flutter 3.41.9 / Dart 3.11.5). Folder layout `lib/{screens,services,models,widgets}`; deps added
(`camera`, `image`, `flutter_onnxruntime`, `google_generative_ai`, `flutter_secure_storage`, `provider`,
`shared_preferences`, `path_provider`); `analysis_options.yaml` (flutter_lints) in place. App boots
to `HomeScreen` with a route into a `SettingsScreen` placeholder. `flutter analyze` clean; smoke
test passes.
> commit: `feat(mobile): flutter scaffold + dependencies`

**S2 — Bundle assets + registry.** ✅ **DONE.** Copied both detector ONNX, the default depth ONNX,
the Depth Anything graph, `food_densities.json`, generated `labels.txt` (86 classes from
`classes.yaml`), and `model_registry.json` under `mobile/assets/`; declared `assets/` directories
in `pubspec.yaml`. **GitHub 100 MB limit:** the four files < 100 MB are committed; the ~99 MB
`depth_anything_v2_small.onnx.data` external-data blob is gitignored and documented for manual
download in the README (default Metric3D path works without it). `AssetCatalog`/`AppCatalog`
([asset_catalog.dart](../mobile/lib/services/asset_catalog.dart)) parse the registry + labels +
densities at startup and assert 86 labels; HomeScreen renders the loaded counts. Unit tests cover
registry/labels/density parsing; `flutter analyze` clean, tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): bundle models, density table, and model registry`

**S3 — Domain models.** ✅ **DONE.** Pure value objects under
[mobile/lib/models/](../mobile/lib/models/): `BBox`, `Detection` (+ `isManual` for FR7), `Shape`
enum + `WeightedItem`, `Recipe` (snake_case JSON matching Gemini), `ModelChoice` (value equality
to detect selection changes), `ScanResult` (with `fromItems` per-class gram aggregation mirroring
`pipeline.py`), and `AppSettings` (nullable model ids → registry defaults, density overrides,
viz toggles, API key; JSON round-trip for S4). Barrel `models.dart`. Unit tests cover aggregation,
Recipe JSON, and AppSettings round-trip; `flutter analyze` clean, 10 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): core domain models`

**S4 — Persistence.** ✅ **DONE.**
[SettingsRepository](../mobile/lib/services/settings_repository.dart) stores the whole
`AppSettings` as one JSON blob in `shared_preferences` (corrupt/absent → defaults).
[SettingsProvider](../mobile/lib/state/settings_provider.dart) (`ChangeNotifier`) holds live
settings, notifies immediately, and write-throughs on every mutator (detector/depth/threshold/
density overrides/toggles/API key); `modelChoice` resolves unset ids to registry defaults.
`main.dart` refactored into an `AppBootstrap` that loads catalog + settings and wraps the
`MaterialApp` in `MultiProvider` **above the Navigator** (so pushed routes can read them), with
splash/error states. HomeScreen now reads from providers and shows the resolved model selection.
Tests cover persistence across provider instances (G3), default resolution, override clearing,
and listener notification; `flutter analyze` clean, 14 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): persistent settings repository`

**S5 — DensityService.** ✅ **DONE.**
[DensityService](../mobile/lib/services/density_service.dart) — immutable, sendable to the scan
isolate. Resolution order override → baseline → `kDefaultDensity` (800, matching `density.py`/
`weight.py`); exposes `densityFor`, `baselineFor`/`isOverridden` (for the S13 editor's reset), and
`densitiesFor(list)`. Constructed per scan from `catalog.densities` + `settings.densityOverrides`.
Tests cover resolution order, baseline-vs-override, and list mapping; `flutter analyze` clean, 17
tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): density service with editable overrides`

**S6 — WeightService (pure Dart).** ✅ **DONE.**
[DepthMap](../mobile/lib/models/depth_map.dart) value type with a `medianIn(bbox)` that matches
`np.median` (integer half-open slicing, averages the two middle values for even counts).
[WeightService](../mobile/lib/services/weight_service.dart) ports `estimate_weights` verbatim:
sphere/cylinder class sets copied from weight.py, pinhole `real=(px/focal)×depth`, depth clamp
[0.1, 10] m, box volume `w·h·max(w,h)·0.5`, `weight_g = vol×density×1000`; static and pure so it
re-runs cheaply for G6. **Parity verified**: reference numbers generated from `pipeline/weight.py`
(focal 800 px) for sphere/cylinder/box, the even-count median (0.55 m), and the depth clamp
(50→10 m) all match within 1e-6; empty-ROI skip covered. `flutter analyze` clean, 23 tests pass.

> Note: the box formula follows the **code** (`w·h·max(w,h)·0.5`), not CLAUDE.md's prose
> (`…×depth_m×0.5`) — the running code is authoritative for parity.
> commit: `feat(mobile): weight estimation (pinhole + shapes) with parity tests`

**S7 — DetectorService.** ✅ **DONE.**
[ort_runtime.dart](../mobile/lib/services/ort_runtime.dart) initialises `OrtEnv` once (shared by
detector + depth). [DetectorService](../mobile/lib/services/detector_service.dart): loads the
selected ONNX from assets via `OrtSession.fromBuffer`; `preprocess` does aspect-preserving
letterbox into 640×640 with centre grey (114) padding, written CHW RGB normalised 0–1 as a
`Float32List`; `decodeDetections` thresholds the NMS-baked `[1,300,6]` rows (default conf 0.10),
un-letterboxes boxes back to original px, clamps to bounds, and maps class ids to labels
(`class_<id>` fallback). Preprocess/decode are pure static methods so they're unit-tested without
native inference; `detect()` glues them with proper ORT tensor/run/output release. Tests cover the
letterbox transform, threshold/rescale/label mapping, clamping, and label fallback;
`flutter analyze` clean, 27 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): YOLO ONNX detector service`

**S8 — DepthService.** ✅ **DONE.**
[DepthService](../mobile/lib/services/depth_service.dart) ports `depth.py`: Metric3D branch
(keep-aspect resize into 616×1064, centre-pad with ImageNet mean in 0–255, normalise, un-pad,
bilinear resize back, de-canonicalise `× focal×scale/1000`) and Depth Anything branch (518×518,
ImageNet 0–1). Pre/post helpers (`preprocessMetric3d`, `preprocessDepthAnything`, `cropPlane`,
`bilinearResize`, `metric3dDecanonFactor`) are pure static + unit-tested.

> **Float16 (resolved via runtime upgrade).** The fp16 Metric3D model has float16 input/output.
> The original `onnxruntime` package (ORT 1.15) couldn't create/read float16 tensors, so an earlier
> approach hand-wrote an FFI binary16 codec. That is now **removed**: the app migrated to
> **`flutter_onnxruntime` (ORT 1.22)**, which has native FP16 — `DepthService` feeds the model with
> `OrtValue.to(OrtDataType.float16)` and reads the float16 output back as doubles via
> `asFlattenedList()`. The registry carries `"precision":"float16"` (→ `DepthModel.float16` →
> `DepthService.fromAsset(float16:)`).

`flutter analyze` clean, tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): depth service (Metric3D + Depth Anything, float16 support)`

**S9 — ScanController + Isolate.** ✅ **DONE.**
[ScanController](../mobile/lib/state/scan_controller.dart) (`ChangeNotifier`, provided in
`main.dart`) orchestrates detect → depth → density → weight with `ScanStatus`
(idle/running/success/error). Model inference runs **off the UI thread** via the services'
`runAsync` — confirmed `OrtIsolateSession` passes the session *address* to a spawned isolate
(native pointers are process-global) and reuses the `fromBuffer` session with no model reload, so
detector/depth `detect`/`estimate` are now `Future`-returning. Services are loaded lazily and
rebuilt only when the `ModelChoice` changes (G4). It **caches** the image, raw depth map, focal,
and detections, and exposes the G6 recompute path: `recompute()`/`updateSettings`/
`applyDistanceCorrection` (S15 hook)/`addManualDetection` (S16 hook) all re-run only the pure-Dart
weight pipeline on the cache. The core is a pure static `computeResult` (depth-scale → density →
weight → aggregate), unit-tested for aggregation, density-override proportionality, depth³ scaling,
manual detections, and default-density fallback. `flutter analyze` clean, 43 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): scan orchestration on isolate with recompute path`

**S10 — ScanScreen + ResultScreen (baseline).** ✅ **DONE.**
[focal.dart](../mobile/lib/services/focal.dart) reads EXIF `FocalLengthIn35mmFilm`
(`focal_px = focal35mm/36 × width`, pure `focalPxFromFocal35mm` helper) with the `width×0.8`
fallback, mirroring weight.py. [ScanScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/scan_screen.dart): live
`CameraPreview` + capture FAB, **plus a bundled-sample strip** (`kSampleImageAssets`) so the user
can scan a sample instead of taking a photo (graceful "camera unavailable" state on simulators).
Capture/select → decode → focal → `ScanController.scan` → push
[ResultScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/result_screen.dart), which reacts to `ScanStatus`
(running/error/empty/success) and lists ingredients with weight + expandable detail (shape,
confidence, depth, real size, density, manual flag). Home "Scan" button wired up; camera
permissions added (Android `CAMERA`, iOS `NSCameraUsageDescription`). Focal computation unit-tested;
`flutter analyze` clean, 45 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): scan and result screens`

**S11 — RecipeService + recipe cards.** ✅ **DONE.**
[RecipeService](../mobile/lib/services/recipe_service.dart) ports recipe.py: one
`gemini-2.0-flash-lite` call (`google_generative_ai`, `responseMimeType: application/json`),
`buildPrompt` mirrors the Python template, `parseRecipes` strips a ```json fence, decodes the
array, and caps at 3. Graceful degradation: empty list on no API key / no ingredients / network /
parse failure (pure helpers unit-tested). The [ScanController](../mobile/lib/state/scan_controller.dart)
runs it as stage ⑤ **after** the weights are shown (separate `recipesLoading` flag, non-blocking),
with `regenerateRecipes()` for on-demand refresh. [ResultScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/result_screen.dart)
shows a recipes section: spinner while loading, recipe cards (name, servings, ingredient chips,
numbered steps), or a "Recipe service not available right now. Try again later." message when
empty (with a hint to set the key in Settings). API key read from the per-user secure-storage value.
`flutter analyze` clean.
> commit: `feat(mobile): Gemini recipe generation and result cards`

**S12 — SettingsScreen: model selection.** ✅ **DONE.**
[SettingsScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart) replaces the placeholder: detector and
depth `RadioGroup` pickers from the registry (depth options flag "needs manual download" for Depth
Anything), a confidence slider (0.05–0.9), and an obscured Gemini API-key field. All wired to
`SettingsProvider` so changes persist (G3) and apply on the next scan (G4); the API key feeds
RecipeService (closes the S11 gap). **Security:** the key is stored in `flutter_secure_storage`
(Keychain/Keystore) and explicitly excluded from the `shared_preferences` JSON blob — per-user, no
bundled shared secret, nothing to reverse-engineer (chose this over `.env`-in-app, which is always
extractable). Used the modern `RadioGroup` ancestor API (RadioListTile's `groupValue`/`onChanged`
are deprecated in Flutter 3.41). Widget tests verify detector/depth selection flows through the
provider; a provider test asserts the key never lands in the prefs blob; `flutter analyze` clean,
55 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): settings screen with detector/depth model selection`

**S13 — Density editor.** ✅ **DONE.**
[DensityEditorScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/density_editor_screen.dart) (reached from a Settings
entry): searchable list of all 86 classes showing the effective kg/m³ (override or baseline) via
`DensityService`, edited through a numeric dialog. Per-row "undo to default" (shows the baseline)
and a global "reset all" in the app bar. Edits persist as overrides (G3) and push into
`ScanController.updateSettings` so the current scan's weights recompute live (G6). Widget test
covers search filtering. `flutter analyze` clean, 56 tests pass.

> **Scan bug fixed (reported during S13).** On-device scan failed with ORT `code=9`
> (NOT_IMPLEMENTED) "Could not find an implementation for Reshape(19)" on the v26m attention
> blocks. Root cause: the mobile ORT 1.15.1 graph **optimizer** emits fused/layout nodes with no
> kernel (the models are opset-19/IR-9, which 1.15 otherwise supports). Fix: set the detector and
> depth sessions to `GraphOptimizationLevel.ortDisableAll` (also what the fp16 Metric3D graph
> needs). Needs on-device re-verification.
> commit: `feat(mobile): editable density table screen`

**S14 — Visualisation toggles (hidden by default).** ✅ **DONE.**
Settings "Developer view" section with two `SwitchListTile`s (show bounding boxes / show depth
map), wired to the already-persisted `showBoxes`/`showDepthMap` flags (G3), off by default.
[ResultScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/result_screen.dart) gains a `_DebugViews` section: the
captured image (`controller.imageBytes`) with a [BoxOverlayPainter](../mobile/lib/widgets/bbox_overlay.dart)
drawing detection boxes + weight labels (manual boxes in orange), and a jet-coloured depth map via
[depth_visualizer.dart](../mobile/lib/services/depth_visualizer.dart) (`renderDepthMapPng`,
downsampled + min/max-normalised, rendered once per depth map and cached). The controller now
exposes `imageBytes` and the effective (distance-corrected) `depthMap`; `scan()` caches the source
bytes. Depth-colorizer unit-tested (downscale size, near→blue/far→red, constant-depth guard).
`flutter analyze` clean, 55 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): optional bbox overlay and depth-map view`

**S15 — Distance correction slider.** ✅ **DONE.**
[ResultScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/result_screen.dart) gains an "Adjust scale (optional)"
expander: a dropdown to pick a detected object + a distance slider (10–120 cm, 1 cm steps). On slider release it
calls `ScanController.applyDistanceCorrection(detection, metres)`, which samples the **raw** median
depth for that bbox and sets `_depthScale = realDistance / rawMedian` (absolute — repeated
corrections don't compound), then recomputes all weights via the pure G6 path. Shows the current
`×scale` and a "Reset scale" action. Applied on `onChangeEnd` (not per tick) to avoid copying the
full-res depth map repeatedly. The controller API now takes a `Detection` (sampling raw depth
itself); the placeholder `WeightedReference` was removed. Unit test confirms the anchored object
reads the set distance after correction. `flutter analyze` clean, 60 tests pass.
> commit: `feat(mobile): manual distance/scale correction with recompute`

**S16 — Manual annotation & relabelling.** ✅ **DONE.**
New [AnnotateScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/annotate_screen.dart), reached via an "Edit items" button on
the result screen, lets the user fix the detection set over the captured image. Two placement modes,
toggled by an app-bar **Smart** switch:
- **Smart (default):** **circle** a missed item (drag a loop); the box is the bounds of what was drawn,
  trimmed inward to the encircled item's near-depth pixels via
  [SmartBoxService.boxFromLoop](../mobile/lib/services/smart_box_service.dart) — the user supplies the
  extent directly (far more reliable than guessing from one point) and depth only shrinks the box to the
  object, never expands past the loop. On the samples a loose 1.4× circle yields a box ~1.1–1.4× the
  detector box; a tight all-object circle is kept as drawn. Tapping an existing box still edits it.
  A tap-only `boxAround` that infers the extent from depth is kept for callers without a loop; it
  estimates the box from the depth map — a data-driven box, **no size priors** (consistent with
  CLAUDE.md). `boxAround` algorithm, tuned and validated against the real Metric3D depth of all three sample
  images: (1) reference depth = the **20th percentile** of an 8 px window at the tap (the object's near
  surface; a robust low percentile, not the strict minimum, which collapsed the box whenever a closer
  neighbour or a noisy pixel clipped the window); (2) cast 72 rays — a ray stays on the object while
  depth tracks its running-minimum **plateau** and ends at the first **depth jump** back to the surface
  behind it (`>max(2 cm, 10 %·plateau)` between adjacent samples), with an absolute-drift backstop and a
  2 px noise tolerance. Keying the edge to a *discontinuity* rather than a fixed band off `ref` lets a
  ray follow an object whose own surface depth varies or sits on a slope, and stop exactly at the step;
  (3) **radius = the 55th percentile of the ray reaches.** Leaks are *directional* — when an item rests
  against an adjacent same-depth surface a whole contiguous arc of rays runs away — so a per-side
  percentile fails (an entire side can leak) but a near-median rejects ~45 % runaway rays. The box is
  the square of that radius (the user drags to fine-tune aspect). On the samples this lands within ~3 %
  of the detector box on average (mean size-ratio 0.97 excluding the one tight fig cluster, which sizes
  to a single fig). *(Earlier attempts — a 4-ray walk, then a similar-depth flood fill, then a
  per-side-percentile radial scan — all over-grew on top-down fridge shots where ~20 % of the frame
  shares the object's depth.)* Manual mode (below) covers the hard flat/edge cases. Shape/weight then
  come from the existing pipeline.
- **Manual:** drag a rectangle by hand (smart selection disabled).
Both open a searchable class picker (all 91 density-table classes) → `addManualDetection`. Tapping an
existing box (detected *or* manual) offers **Change label** (`relabelDetection`) or **Remove**
(`removeDetection`). Detector output is never mutated: relabels/removals are stored as overlay maps in
the controller and applied during the pure recompute (`effectiveDetections`), so everything updates live
(G6) with no model re-inference and a re-scan starts clean. `SmartBoxService` is unit-tested (6 tests:
extent, edge clamp, invalid/flat depth, median compatibility). `flutter analyze` clean, 66 tests pass.

**S17 — On-device eval & polish.** ✅ **DONE.**
Final mobile polish pass: [ScanController](../mobile/lib/state/scan_controller.dart) now records
per-scan elapsed time for the CV path (model setup + detector + depth + weight recompute; recipes
remain async), and [ResultScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/result_screen.dart) shows developer-mode
timing chips (seconds, detections, weighed items, active scale). Error and idle states now have
explicit recovery actions, the empty-result state lets the user annotate missed items or scan again,
and [ScanScreen](../mobile/lib/screens/scan_screen.dart) exposes camera-startup errors while keeping
sample-image fallback. Added widget coverage for the S17 result states.

Evaluation/report close-out is in [phase3_report.md](phase3_report.md): G1 passes with a 7 s average
capture-to-CV-result time on a Pixel 9 simulator against the <10 s target, and G2 passes from the
shipped detector training log (`mAP50-95 = 0.552`, `docs/results.csv` epoch 25).

## 8. Dependencies (pubspec)

`camera`, `image` (EXIF + pixel ops + draw), `flutter_onnxruntime` (ORT 1.22),
`google_generative_ai`, `flutter_secure_storage` (API key at rest), `provider`,
`shared_preferences`, `path_provider`.

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `epoch40.onnx` missing | S0 exports it before bundling |
| Two detectors + two depth ONNX ≈ 320 MB bundle | acceptable for the academic demo; if needed, mark `depthanything` an eval-only asset |
| Metric3D fp16 won't load on mobile ORT | reduced graph-opt level (see depth.py); fall back to fp32 reduced if required |
| EXIF focal stripped by camera plugin → wrong metric scale | read focal from camera metadata; ×0.8 fallback; FR6 lets the user correct it |
| Class-order mismatch after export | ship `labels.txt`; assert length 86 at load |
| Metric3D scale ambiguity on featureless close-ups | documented limitation; FR6 distance correction is the in-app fix |
